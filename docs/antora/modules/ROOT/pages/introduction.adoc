== What is Jam Pad?

link:https://www.helgoboss.org/projects/jampad[Jam Pad] is a versatile app for managing recordings and musical ideas.

It is designed to be a practical tool for everyone who deals with audio recordings, such as musicians, composers, sound artists, music teachers, podcasters, bands, classical ensembles and music studios.

=== Core concepts

Jam Pad is built around just a few core concepts:

xref:key-concepts.adoc#clip[Clips]::
Clips are audio recordings — improvisations, jam sessions, work-in-progress song versions (raw, mixed, or mastered), finished tracks, podcast episodes, field recordings, one-shot samples… anything!

xref:key-concepts.adoc#marker[Markers]::
Markers are positions within potentially very long clips. Use them to quickly jump to notable passages -- musical ideas, sections that need work, specific scenes, or anything else you want to revisit.

xref:key-concepts.adoc#playlist[Playlists]::
Playlists let you arrange clips and markers in any order, creating your own sequence for review or playback.

xref:key-concepts.adoc#sheet[Sheets]::

Sheets are simple text documents but with a twist: You can embed **instantly playable** clips or markers.

To keep everything neatly organized, Jam Pad uses the concept of xref:key-concepts.adoc#space[spaces]. A space is a self-contained collection of all the items described above.

There are three types of spaces:

xref:key-concepts.adoc#single-device-space[Single-device spaces]::
Fully offline spaces that exist only on one specific mobile device or computer.

xref:key-concepts.adoc#multi-device-space[Multi-device spaces]::
Spaces that sync directly between your phones and computers without using the cloud.

xref:key-concepts.adoc#cloud-space[Cloud spaces]::
Spaces that sync through the cloud and support collaboration features.

=== Supported platforms

Jam Pad runs natively on the following platforms:

- Android phones and tablets
- iOS phones and tablets
- macOS computers

Support for the following platforms is planned:
